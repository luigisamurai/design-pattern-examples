# Design Pattern Principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
1. Favor composition over inheritance.
1. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
1. Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.
1. Open-Closed Principle : Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
1. Depend  on abstractions.  Don't depend on concrete classes.
